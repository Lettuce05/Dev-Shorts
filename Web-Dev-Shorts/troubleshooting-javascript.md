# Troubleshooting JavaScript

## Types of error

-   Syntax errors - Spelling errors that stop your code from running
-   Logic errors - Syntax is correct, and program runs successfully, but unintended results are produced

## Common Errors

-   (Syntax) Miss spelling a word(variable, function, class, method, reserved words)
-   (Logic) Simple Math errors
-   (Syntax) Missing ; before statement - usually means you forgot a semi-colon at the end of a line
-   (Logic) Using the assignment operator(=) and the equality(==) or strict equality(===) operators improperly
-   (Syntax) Missing ) after argument list - usually means you forgot a closing paranthesis at the end of a function/method call
-   (Syntax) Missing : after property id - Usually relates to an incorrectly formed JS object, but it can also be caused by the misplacement of a closing paranthesis
-   (Syntax) Missing } after function body - Usually means you've missed a curly brace at the end of a function or conditional structure
-   (Syntax) Expected expression, got 'string' or unterminated string literal - Both errors are usually caused by forgetting a closing quote mark at the end of a string value.
    -   First error is given when the string has been replaced with unexpected characters that the browser found in the later code instead of the quote mark
    -   Second error is given when a string has not been ended with a quote mark

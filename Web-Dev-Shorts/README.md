# Inspirations and Study Technique

This book is inspired by the Feynman technique. Richard Feynman developed a study technique that would allow complex subjects to be illustrated in simple terms. Explaining complex subjects in simple terms or diagrams shows a deep understanding of a topic. Feynman's technique also involved documenting everything learned about a subject and relating or connecting the subject with other interests or fields of study. These connections help to actually commit subjects to memory rather than merely memorizing them for the moment while learning the subject. My hope for this book is to explain web development concepts in simple terms and diagrams, allowing for a full grasp and deeper understanding of concepts. Below are the key components of Feynman's Technique:

   1. Identify the subject
      - Document everything about the subject, add more as you learn
   2. Teach it to a child
      - Simplify ideas into plain terms
      - Brevity - Keep it short
   3. Identify knowledge gaps
   4. Organize, simplify, and tell a story

This book will only focus on the last component but I have another book(Web Dev Shorts Extended) where all of my studies will be recorded which is covered by steps one and three of Feynman's Technique.

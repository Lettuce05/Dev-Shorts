# How the Internet Works

### The internet is just a very complex vending machine.

Simply put, the internet is requests and responses between your computer and another computer. Even more simply, you can think of the internet as using a vending machine. You request items from the vending machine, usually through entering a number or combination of letters and numbers. The vending machine then finds the item that belongs to that id and drops the item for you.

In this analogy, the numbers and letters you press (your request), would be the url (ex. www.google.com) you enter in the browser. The process of the vending machine finding the location of the item, would be the DNS (Domain Name System) which is a server that stores domain names (ex. google) and their associated IP addresses  (location). You can also think of the DNS as the phonebook of the internet. The dropping of the item, would be the response from the server(computer with specific software) at the specified IP address. Then the item you recieve from the vending machine would be the website you requested (aka google.com).

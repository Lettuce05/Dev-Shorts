# Dev-Shorts
This book series will be a collection living documents, where I note my learnings as I progress through different areas of software development. Each main subject will have two corresponding books, a "Shorts" version which will contain a simplified explanation of each concept covered, and a "Shorts Extended" version which will contain all of the notes/findings that I have acquired while learning a concept. My hope for this series is to help explain complex development concepts into simpler terms, and therefore helping myself and anyone who reads these to have a full grasp and deeper understanding of each concept.

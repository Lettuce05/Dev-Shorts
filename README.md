# Dev-Shorts
This book series will be a collection living documents, where I note my learnings as I progress through different areas of software development. Each main subject will have two corresponding books, a "Shorts" version which will contain a simplified explanation of each concept covered, and a "Shorts Extended" version which will contain all of the notes/findings that I have acquired while learning a concept. My hope for this series is to help explain complex development concepts into simpler terms, and therefore helping myself and anyone who reads these to have a full grasp and deeper understanding of each concept.

# Inspirations and Study Technique

This series is inspired by the Feynman technique. Richard Feynman developed a study technique that would allow complex subjects to be illustrated in simple terms. Explaining complex subjects in simple terms or diagrams shows a deep understanding of a topic. Feynman's technique also involved documenting everything learned about a subject and relating or connecting the subject with other interests or fields of study. These connections help to actually commit subjects to memory rather than merely memorizing them for the moment while learning the subject. Below are the key components of Feynman's Technique:

   1. Identify the subject
      - Document everything about the subject, add more as you learn
   2. Teach it to a child
      - Simplify ideas into plain terms
      - Brevity - Keep it short
   3. Identify knowledge gaps
   4. Organize, simplify, and tell a story

The "Shorts" version of each subject/book covers step 4, and the "Shorts Extended" version covers steps 1 and 3.

# Unity Shorts
This book will be a collection of quick tutorials and code snippets for different concepts in unity game development. These tutorials and snippets will contain code examples and explanations for different functions or aspects of game development, and I will add them as I encounter them in my own learning process. My hope for this  book is that it will be a good reference for different nuances of game development, and that it will help someone come to the desired solution faster. Hopefully these short tutorials and explanations help in understanding the problems that are occuring, and the solutions given rather than just copying code.
